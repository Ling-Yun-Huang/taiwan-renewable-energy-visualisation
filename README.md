# ⚡ Taiwan Renewable Energy Forecasting and Visualising

🏷️ **Tags:** `R` 📊, `JavaScript` 🌐, `Shiny` 🔥

This project analyses and forecasts Taiwan’s renewable energy development, with particular emphasis on the **2016 energy policy reforms**. 

It combines **interactive visualisations** and **time-series forecasting** to help policymakers and stakeholders quickly understand trends, assess progress toward targets, and compare forecasting models.

> *“Explore Taiwan’s renewable energy journey from 2005 to 2025, and see how close we are to the 20% renewable energy goal.”*

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Observable** – Interactive visualisations (JavaScript) 🌐  
- **R** – Time-series forecasting, analysis, and plotting (ggplot2) 📊  
- **Shiny** – Interactive dashboard for exploration 🔥

## 📈 Insights & Findings

- Renewable energy generation has **steadily increased**, with a **notable acceleration after 2016**.  
- **Solar energy** drives most of the growth, with **clear seasonal patterns** (higher in summer, lower in winter).  
- **Wind energy** shows gradual improvement, with **winter peaks**.  
- **Forecasting models** suggest that **reaching 20% by 2025 is unlikely**, but **2027 may be more realistic**.
