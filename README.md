# 🌱 Visualizing Taiwan's Renewable Energy Progress (2005–2023)

This project analyzes Taiwan's renewable energy progress from **2005 to 2023**, focusing on changes before and after the **2016 energy policy reforms**. Using **Observable**, we present interactive visualizations to explore trends, assess progress toward **Taiwan’s 2025 renewable energy goals**, and evaluate different forecasting models.

## 🔹 Project Overview

This project was part of the **Master’s in Data Science** program (*Data Visualization* course) at **City, University of London** (2024), where it received a **Distinction**.

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Observable** – Interactive visualizations using **JavaScript**
- **Python** – Data preprocessing and predictive modeling
- **Markdown** – Report documentation

## 📊 Research Questions

1. **How has Taiwan’s renewable energy generation evolved over the past 20 years, particularly before and after 2016?**  
2. **With two years remaining, how close is Taiwan to its goal of 20% renewable energy by 2025? Based on current trends, is this goal achievable?**

## 🔍 Data Source

- **Dataset**: Taiwan's [open data platform](http://data.gov.tw/en). For use, please follow its [LICENSE](https://data.gov.tw/en/licenses).  
- **Timeframe**: 2005–2023  
- **Features**: Monthly power generation data by energy source  
- **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning and transformation using Python  

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Renewable energy generation has consistently increased**, with a significant acceleration after 2016.  
- **Solar energy** has been the primary driver of growth, exhibiting a clear seasonal pattern (*higher in summer, lower in winter*).  
- **Wind energy** has shown more gradual improvement, with notable gains in recent years and seasonal peaks (*higher in winter, lower in summer*).  
- **Regression models** suggest that reaching the **20% target by 2025 is unlikely**, but **2027 may be a more realistic goal** given current trends.  

## 🎨 Visualization Approach

This project follows Jonathan Corum’s ["See, Think, Design, Produce"](http://style.org/stdp3/) framework and integrates design principles from:  
- **Munzner’s "Visualization Analysis and Design"**  
- **Wilkinson’s "Grammar of Graphics"**  

Key visualization techniques include:  
- **Stacked area charts & line charts** – Provide both an overview and detailed insights.  
- **Seasonality analysis** – Highlights recurring patterns in solar and wind energy generation.  
- **Regression models** – Compare linear and polynomial predictions for future renewable energy growth.
