[⬅ Back to R results](README.md) | [⬅ Back to Project Overview](../README.md)

---

### 📈 Forecast Objective

- Building upon *the best-performing model (ARIMA)* identified in the model validation stage, this section projects Taiwan’s **2025 renewable energy generation** to evaluate progress toward the **20% renewable energy goal**.
- Forecasts were generated for each renewable source from 2005-2024 and then aggregated to obtain the total projected renewable generation for 2025.

### 🔹 Annual Forecast Summary

| Year            | Renewable Generation (GWh) | Year-on-Year Growth |
| --------------- | -------------------------: | ------------------: |
| 2024 (actual)   |                     33,917 | —                   |
| 2025 (forecast) |                     45,640 | **+34.6%**          |

> **Insight:**
> The upward trajectory suggests consistent expansion, aligning with recent investment trends in solar and wind capacity.

#### 🔹 Detail by Sources

| Energy Source | 2024 Actual (GWh) | 2025 Forecast (GWh) | Growth (%) | Key Driver                         |
| ------------- | ----------------: | ------------------: | ---------: | ---------------------------------- |
| Solar         |            15,296 |              17,534 |     +14.7% | New PV capacity & rooftop adoption |
| Wind          |            10,510 |              19,773 |     +88.2% | Offshore wind projects scaling up  |
| Hydropower    |             4,208 |               4,319 |      +2.6% | Limited expansion capacity         |
| Geothermal    |                27 |                  25 |      -7.4% | Too small      |
| Biomass       |               238 |                 240 |      +0.8% | Stay stable       |
| Waste         |             3,638 |               3,749 |      +3.0% | Stay stable   |

> **Insight:**  
> - Solar and Wind are the main drivers of growth.  
> - Hydropower and other sources remain relatively stable.  

### 🔹 Trend and Target Assessment

</p>

Despite continued growth, projections indicate that **Taiwan may reach around 15% renewable share by 2025**,
suggesting **additional acceleration is needed** to meet the **20% renewable energy target** within the next few years.

> Policy implication: Strengthening investment in solar and offshore wind remains critical
> to closing the gap toward the 20% benchmark.

### 🔹 Summary Insights

* **Model used:** ARIMA (selected for best 2024 performance)
* **Forecast period:** 2025 (based on 2005–2024 data)
* **Expected renewable share:** ~15% of total electricity generation
* **Main growth drivers:** Solar and wind capacity expansion
* **Challenge:** Current pace insufficient to achieve 20% by 2025
