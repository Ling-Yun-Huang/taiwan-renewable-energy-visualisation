### üìà Forecast Objective

- Building upon *the best-performing model (ARIMA)* identified in the model validation stage, this section projects Taiwan‚Äôs **2025 renewable energy generation** to evaluate progress toward the **20% renewable energy goal**.
- Forecasts were generated for each renewable source from 2005-2024 and then aggregated to obtain the total projected renewable generation for 2025.

> Solar and wind dominate Taiwan‚Äôs renewable generation with clear seasonal variation, while other sources remain steady.  
> Overall renewable output is forecasted to rise steadily through 2025.

### üîπ Trend and Target Assessment

<p align="center">
  <img src="figures/forecast_2025_target.png" width="600">
</p>

Despite continued growth, projections indicate that **Taiwan may reach around 15% renewable share by 2025**,
suggesting **additional acceleration is needed** to meet the **20% renewable energy target** within the next few years.

> Policy implication: Strengthening investment in solar and offshore wind remains critical
> to closing the gap toward the 20% benchmark.

### üîπ Summary Insights

* **Model used:** ARIMA (selected for best 2024 performance)
* **Forecast period:** 2025 (based on 2005‚Äì2024 data)
* **Expected renewable share:** ~15% of total electricity generation
* **Main growth drivers:** Solar and wind capacity expansion
* **Challenge:** Current pace insufficient to achieve 20% by 2025
