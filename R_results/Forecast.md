### 📈 Forecast Objective

- Building upon *the best-performing model (ARIMA)* identified in the model validation stage, this section projects Taiwan’s **2025 renewable energy generation** to evaluate progress toward the **20% renewable energy goal**.
- Forecasts were generated for each renewable source from 2005-2024 and then aggregated to obtain the total projected renewable generation for 2025.

</p>

Despite continued growth, projections indicate:
- Taiwan may reach ~15% renewable share by 2025.
- Additional acceleration is needed to meet the 20% target.

---

### 🔹 Summary Insights

- **Model:** ARIMA (best 2024 performance)
- **Forecast year:** 2025 (data: 2005–2024)
- **Expected renewable share:** ~15% of total generation
- **Main growth drivers:** Solar and wind
- **Challenge:** Pace insufficient to reach 20% by 2025
